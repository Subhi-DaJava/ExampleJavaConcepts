/**
 * Both approaches to the reference in action
 *
 * The basic rule goes like this:
 * If class A is a "superclass of class B" and "class B is a superclass of class C" then "a variable of class A" can reference "any object derived from that class"
 * (for instance, objects of "the class B" and "the class C"). This is possible because each subclass object is an object of its superclass but not vice versa.
 *
 * Note:
 * "A superclass reference" can be used for any of "its subclass objects", but you cannot assign "an object of the parent class" to "the reference of its subclass"
 * When referring to "objects with a superclass reference" you "cannot invoke methods and fields of a subclass"
 *
 * Always cast "an object of a subclass" to a superclass â€” and vice versa, but only if the object is indeed "an instance of the subclass".
