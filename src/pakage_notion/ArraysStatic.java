/**
 * Default Package
 * If we do not write a package statement before defining our class, it will be placed inside the default package.
 * This package has a big disadvantage â€” classes located here can't be imported to classes located inside named packages.
 *
 * Do not use the default package for real applications.
 * It is perfectly fine for simple, educational applications, like "Hello world", but more complex projects will be better in named packages.
